## Logging In to the WA SOC Incident Reporting Portal (IRP)
You can access the new ITSM portal at [WA Security Operations Centre - IRP](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals "https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals"). An account will need to be provisioned for your user to access this, if you don't already have an account on this portal, please ask an existing account holder to request one using the [Request access to the Incident Reporting Portal - WASOC IRP](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/1/create/8) form.

When logging in you will be prompted to use Single Sign On, please do this and **Continue with Microsoft** for your Atlassian Identity.

### Creating an Incident
The process for manually creating an incident is below:
- Navigate to the [Report a cyber incident - WASOC IRP](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/1/create/19) form
- Enter the details of your incident
- Select **Share with** your organisation

You can view all of your security teams incidents here - [Requests - WASOC IRP](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/requests?page=1&reporter=all)

Most incident creation can be done automatically via a webhook ingestion configured from your SIEM. The WA SOC has an ingestion connector for Sentinel that can be configured by default for your Security Operations Team (for further information on this please reach out via the [Request Assistance - WASOC IRP](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/1/create/1)) form.

### Comments and updates
Once an incident is created there may be further discussion required to complete or resolve the incident. This can be done by adding comments to one of your existing incidents in the portal. Note that as incidents are worked on the reporter will receive email updates that should include a link back to the relevant incident.

### Reporting
A summary of incident statistics and associated metrics will be included in the SOC monthly reports for your organisation.
