# Collecting Evidence

During incident response activities, organisations may need to share evidence. Below is a process using [Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer) to do this securely.

## Creating a [blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container) to receive evidence

## Uploading evidence to a [blob container securely using a SAS url](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=windows#attach-to-an-individual-resource)
