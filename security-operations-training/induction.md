# SOC Analyst Induction
## Overview

The below guidance is to get a novice with basic IT literacy up to speed with common Security Operations activities all the way from collecting events, alerting on detections, triaging alerts, responding to incidents and managing detection rules and investigative queries.

## Prerequisites
To get started with SOC activities in the Microsoft Sentinel environment it is sensible to have administrative access to both a [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365) tenant and a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/) subscription.

There are developer/student versions available for free that should be sufficient for the training exercises below:

- [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) - Free for anyone with a mobile number, no credit card required.
- [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/free/students/) - Free for anyone with an edu email address, no credit card required.
- [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/free/) - Free for anyone with a credit card verification step, no ongoing payment required.
- [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) - Free desktop tool for python notebooks to complete security research and investigations.

Please use the above links or existing services to organise yourself admin access, then work through the training below.
